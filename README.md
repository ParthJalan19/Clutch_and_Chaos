# Automobile_Website
Clutch &amp; Chaos is a premium automotive website showcasing sports cars and motorcycles. Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, and Tailwind CSS, it is fully responsive and includes category-based filtering with a clean, modern UI. The project strengthened my front-end and responsive design skills.
